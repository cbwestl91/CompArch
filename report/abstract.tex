\chapter(*Abstract)
A modern day computer has a CPU that have a tremendous processing power. However, the transmission rate on the RAM is still relatively low. This can be solved by adding a memory cache between the CPU and RAM. The performance of the cache is determent by how many memory hits the CPU does in the cache. If it does not hit anyone, it has to access it from the RAM anyway. If the the cache as a prefetcher that will determine what memorylocation that is going to be fetched next, the Memory misses will be tremendously decreased.
