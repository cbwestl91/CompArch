This paper presents a pattern-recognizing prefetcher based on the DCPT prefetching heuristic by Marius Grannae, Magnus Jahre and Lasse Natvig. The prefetcher attempts to achieve high accuracy through strict rules for the next fetch based on a previously recognized fetch sequence. This is comparable to using the principle of locality, where the nearest addresses are cached. The prefetcher detailed in this report employs strict rules for which addresses that are fetched, and attempts to log all occurring prefetch sequences.
