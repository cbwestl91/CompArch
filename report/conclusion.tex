All in all the prefetcher is comparable to a deterministic implementation of the more stochastic principle of locality approach. The idea of mapping possible sequences directly to their assumed following address might work in a predictable environment, but does not seem to function well in practice. A more useful approach would be to cache the most frequently accessed addresses, or simply the address area around a request. Another reason for the prefetcher's low performance is the size of the accessed memory spaces. With so many combinations, it is a lot less likely that the same sequences will be frequented.
