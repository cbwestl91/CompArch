\section*{Prefetcher Description}

The prefetcher has a pattern-seeking behaviour. It uses vectors to log observed fetch sequences, and ranks them based on how often the fetches correspond with the sequence. 


The access sequences that occur the least frequent are more prone to being removed in the favour of new sequences.
