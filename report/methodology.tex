\section*{Simulator}
The framework provided with the assignment was used for simulation. Our code was at first uploaded to the Kongull cluster, but this took a lot of time due to long queue times. The framework was therefore installed on one of our computers, running on Linux CentOS. This worked fine, but most of our other computers couldn't run the simulator because the GCC/G++ versions were too new. 

The simulator used was the modified M5 simulator provided with the assignment.
